The continaer will have isolated set of ports.
It can access the internet (outbound) is not restricted.
For any inboud, it is restricted, we need to map the port of the container to the external network container.

docker build .
	- uses the Dockerfile to build the image(s) using the docker instructions
	- for each instruction, an temp container (with image from the previous step) is created with the instruction and will be passed on to the next instruction.
	- docker will try to use the exiting cache if any.
	- if any change is made in the Dockerfile, only the images has to be rebuilt from the instruction where the change is made. Else it uses caches to fetch the images.

docker build -t <docker_id>/<label>:<verion> .
	- docker build -t madhavanr:spring-test:latest .
	- here `madhavanr` is my docker hub id. `spring-test` is my project name or label.
	- by building the Dockerfile, the project directory and files will not be available to the container by default.
	- so we need to copy the jar or project files to the container before building and starting the application.

docker run -p <local_port>:<container_port> <docker_id>/<label>

docker run -p <local_port>:<container_port> <container_id>
