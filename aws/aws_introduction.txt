USERS:

GROUPS:

	- made of documents (JSON)
	- permission to what user group/ role/ user can able to do.

ROLES:
	- for aws resources.
	- like write/ read etc..


For IAM users, the region is always GLOBAL.
Its is not specific to any region.
Whatever we do in IAM page is for root user.


Creating new Users:
	- Programmatic access
	- AWS Management Console access



	- create a group or add the user to the existing group.
	Once added to the group, we can add tags.

	- we will get 
		- User
		- Access Key ID

		- Password
